  Handwriting digits and character recognitions have become increasingly important in today's digitized world due to their practical applications in various day to day activities. It can be proven by the fact that in recent years, different recognition systems have been developed or proposed to be used in different fields where high classification efficiency is needed. 
Handwriting Recognition is one of the active areas of research where deep neural networks are being utilized. Recognizing handwriting is an easy task for humans but a daunting task for computers. And so systems that are used to recognize handwriting letters, characters, and digits help people to solve more complex tasks that otherwise would be time-consuming and costly. 
The purpose of this project is to take handwritten English Characters in the form of a paragraph as an input, process the paragraph which will have support for cursive writing and symbols, then train the neural network algorithm, which will recognize the text. The neural network model which we have used is Convolutional Neural Network. OpenCV will be used to perform horizontal-vertical segmentation. We are going to build a Neural Network (NN) which will be trained on word-images from the IAM dataset.
